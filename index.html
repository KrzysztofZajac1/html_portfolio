      <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto fs-5 text">
       A little about me.  Originally born in Poland and moving to Ireland when I was 6 year's old,
        my whole life has been spent living here so I decided to change that. I am an individual who enjoys travelling,
         pushing my limits and working hard to achieve anything I put my mind to. Hence why I decided to start learning programming and web design.
          For a challange and also a better future. <br> <br> Another Interest I have is knives,
           I enjoy customizing and modding them using methods such as anodizing, acid washing and flame anodizing.

      <p class="lead">This was my first webpage built using only CSS and HTML, This was completed around 4 days into my journey of programming.
         I know its not anything incredible but we all start somewhere and I think this wasnt a bad start for me as it thought me plenty about HTML and CSS.
          Overall this was step number one and it's what got the ball rolling to begin with.</p>

      <p class="lead">This page was built using CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and Flexbox.
         This was a big improvement in my opinion and it really dedicated me to push on with my journey after seeing the results after about a week and a half of working with programing.
          There is still a lot to improve on but this was the start to learning how to make webpage's look sorted and clean.
           Now none of the buttons work as this was just the design for a hompage and I had nowhere to expand the page but with more research and time I could definitely make this a fully functioning website.</p>

      <p class="lead">Now this was my latest website the I build using the same languages as before and I think it also turned out very well put together considering this marked my 2 week mark.
         Same as my previous website none of the buttons lead you anywhere but as stated previously I have a lot more to learn and think that with time I wont have a problem making the website fully fledged.
         This website Includes a subscription service with price tag's and download links for phones. If this were a real app. </p>
